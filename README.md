erosion sim
------------
This is an implementation of the thermal and hydraulic erosion models from Jacob Olsen in
the paper ["Realtime Procedural Terrain Generation."](http://web.mit.edu/cesium/Public/terrain.pdf)

The motivation behind this project was to create a model of seasonal flooding for my 2018 
summer research project at Penn ([visualizing the past](http://www.visualizingthepast.net/visualizingthepast)). Since we need to show how the
terrain we had in Unreal would flatten out over time, I modified algorithm proposed in the 
paper to achieve a uniform terrain quicker. This was done scaling the rate of erosion by 
the terrain's mean height gradient at each iteration of the algorithm. 

Since the base terrain is built from heightmap data generated by FBM noise, this code could 
be extended for use with Unreal by adding support for importing and exporting heightmap images.
